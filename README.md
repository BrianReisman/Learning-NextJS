Learning NextJS

Notes:
- 


## styling
[] No import needed
[] Inside your JSX add an HTML <style></style> tag
[] To the opening tag at the prop 'jsx' without a value
[] In between the tags use {} to escape from JSX land
[] Inside the {} use backticks `` (just like stlyed-components) to also wrap all of your styling code.
[] Everything that follows is 1. in JS and 2. can be written like any other CSS.

## custom error handling
[] add a file titled "_error.js" to the pages folder
